ObjectId(59fd5c2ec1668e6f02250a14),"Hello guys, Please I’m having an issue implementing a double authentication (if I’m permitted to call it that) on my feathers app. The issue is, I have a user model and also a worker model in which they both contain a unique email field. So when logging in, if the client specifies worker: true in the request body, I want it to lookup the worker table and not the default user table. I have tried a lot of methods to bypass this, the simplest of which is having a beforeHook for my authentication endpoint:
if (hook.data.worker) {

    let config = hook.app.get('authentication');

    config.service = 'worker';

    config.local.service = 'worker';

    hook.app.set('authentication', config);

    return hook;
}

But I noticed this didn’t change anything probably because app.configure(authentication) has auto-configured the app to lookup the user table the first time the server is lifted. Please, how do I go about this? I have done a lot of googling around and reading docs. Thanks."

ObjectId(59fd5c35c1668e6f02250ac1),"Architecture question with Feathers. We have two use-cases where we need to query an oauth_clients table. 1. During the Oauth flow within code, ie. app.service('oauth-clients').find().... 2. As a public endpoint to be queried via ajax. $.get(‘/api/oauth-clients’) In situation 1, we don’t need any permission checking as that’s handled by the Oauth implementation. In situation 2 we want, for example, to validate the Bearer token and scope the results to only ones that the users owns. As far as I can tell we can’t use the same service to do both unless we add exceptions to shared hooks or some sort of checks to see what protocol is being used. So my question is do you think it’s better practice to create multiple services, or customize the hooks to check how they’re being called, ie. locally vs RESTfully. Or, to forego services in the oauth-2-server plugin and drop down to directly using knex for queries? Thank you for any input!"

ObjectId(59fd5ec0c1668e6f02250b38),"(function(context, query, include, inject) => object) Determining what the params should be for a service call made within a hook can get complicated because what is needed depends on how your hooks use context.params and what they expect in context.params. For example - Should the service call be made as the server or as the client? - Should the service call's populate hooks, if any, be performed or not? - What authentication information should be passed along? This convenience method helps you form the params you need. - context (*required*, object) The current context, the one wanting to make the service call. - query (*optional, object) The query object to be used. - include (*optional*, string or array of strings) The properties in the current context to be retained in the service call. The default is ['provider', 'authenticated', 'user']. - inject (*optional*, object) Other properties to be added to the calling params. **ProTip:** By default, none of the populate hooks in the called service will be performed.

ObjectId(59fd5f00c1668e6f02250b75),@joao.azevedo are you able to post a link to a small example where we can reproduce the issue? A few common things that trip people up: 1. Make sure you have the latest versions of the auth and the plugins. 2. Make sure you are registering the hooks for the authentication service (this is going to be made more clear soon) 3. Make sure your user actually exists in the DB (we’re planning on making this more visible) 4. If after that it’s still not working run your app with DEBUG=feathers-authentication* npm start and see what the configurations look like to make sure your services are initialized with the correct values. You can read more about debugging here: https://docs.feathersjs.com/guides/advanced/debugging.html If you can’t figure it out after all that then please create an issue with an example of how to reproduce it. 😄 Auth is pretty complicated. Lots of moving parts and potential configurations so it’s hard for us to debug without examples that reproduce the issue.

 request$.rateLimit(2, 1000, true).subscribe(value => console.log('value'))

ObjectId(59fd5f69c1668e6f02250bd0),hey marshall thank you for the response! i’m realizing trying to re-implement the feathers-authentication-client might not be the best approach. perhaps you could help me with the current issue i’m encountering. the app I’m working on actually has feathers implemented on the client side. The issue that I’ve discovered is that either socket.io or feathers frequently quits attempting to reconnect after losing connection (half the time it just keeps retrying the other half it just gives up after like 3-4 attempts). Overall I feel like it is better to have control over how often we retry a connection anyways. After reading up on socket.io documentation I realized I could manually attempt reconnections and then simply turn off the setting for socket.io to automatically attempt reconnections. This worked except it introduced another issue and that was since feathers wraps around the socket manager if a connection wasn’t established on the first try there would be no retries (since the automatic retry had been turned off since i’m using a manual retry) and I’m assuming somewhere under the hood feathers is running socketManager.connect() but I don’t have access to the callback to tell the app what to do if it is a failed connect.

Does serialization take place any time your piping to stderr and stdout and would that warning indicate we are trying to pass some self referencing object to stderr? Or is there another process that requires serialization that I am not thinking of.

The host field in the config is for convenience if you need to do link building (like for emails or oauth), we don’t use it to specify a host to run on. If you are trying to hit your server on a fresh debian install on Digital Ocean you might need to check your iptables or firewall setup. > What is the recommended database? We don’t have a recommended database. In our opinion the DB should be chosen based on the type of data you need to store and your application read/write requirements. All the DBs work just great and the beauty of Feathers is that if one doesn’t work for you and you’re not writing a lot of DB specific code (ie. you are sticking with hooks) then it’s usually only a few lines to swap a database to a different one. Your application code stays the same 😄"

Feathers DB agnostic query supports https://docs.feathersjs.com/api/databases/querying.html . You have use specialized features to pass through native requests through the Feathers adapter.
ObjectId(59fd5f6ec1668e6f02250c4c),"Hi @daffl An example might be better to explain what I'm actually trying to achieve and what my problem is. I want to create is a REST API for a Raspbery Pi with a bunch of sensors attached. For this I have a service called meta that will store meta-data about a sensor (type, location, and etc.) and a service called item that stores the actual reading of a sensor. I will expose the data of meta and item through a custom service that is called tree. I have an initial configuration file that looks like this:
[
    {
        ""item"": {
            ""n"": ""humid"",
            ""value type"": ""number"",
            ""gpio"": 12
        },
        ""meta"": {
            ""type"": ""humidity sensor"",
            ""location"": ""room 1""
        },
        ""endpoint"": ""/humid""
    },
    {
        ""item"": {
            ""n"": ""temp"",
            ""value type"": ""number"",
            ""gpio"": 10
        },
        ""meta"": {
            ""type"": ""temp sensor"",
            ""location"": ""room 2""
        },
        ""endpoint"": ""/temp""
    }
]

During boot (and before the server starts) two thing must happen: 1. For each sensor in config file I need to establish the connection with it and wait for the first reading. 2. Next I will grab the config file and store the data of each meta object in meta DB and item object in item DB. ( At this point service meta and the item must already be running) When this is done I will have a structure that looks like this:
{
    ""/"": {
        ""temp"": {
            ""itemID"": ""gfd58g1d5g1d5"",
            ""metaID"": ""5gd98g4d81gd5"",
        },
        ""humid"": {
            ""itemID"": ""1234567989"",
            ""metaID"": ""556f5dfd6f5"",
        }
    }
}

This structure will act as a resource tree and it will be stored in the custom service called tree. Only after this structure is created I may start the server. An example of interaction with this tree service will look like this: 1 Client makes a request like GET /tree/temp Content-Type: application/link+json 2 treeservice will search for the requested endpoint in the resource tree structure and will get the metaID of temp 3 The response will only contain the meta-data about the temp sensor. My first approach was to add to the to the trees constructor (src/service/tree/tree.class.js) something like this:
class Service {
  constructor (options) {
    this.options = options || {}
    this.tree = boot.bootstrapper('../boot-config.json', this.options.app) --> async method that will create the resource tree structure presented above
  }

  find () {...}
  get () {...}
}

But when I start the server it goes up before that boot.bootstrapper() get resolved... So what I need is to delay the start of the server until the boot.bootstrapper() get resolved. Does this makes sense to you?"

Hello friends! I've been using feathers as my backend for a more traditional multi page webapp, and I was getting weird behavior when trying to use the express authentication middleware with local, so I just wrote my own middleware to authenticate the user, grab a JWT token, then I use y'all's setCookie middleware so protected routes can authenticate with jwt using that httpOnly cookie.

ObjectId(59fd5ff5c1668e6f02250d6e),"Hi ! First of all, thank you for feathersJS, I'm currently learning it to deploy my new app ! But a little question about authentication in feathers. I well understand how it works with email+password, but I want to use a different way. Actually, I'm coding a react native app, and I don't want the users to login or register themselves. On the first launching of the app, a new user is automatically created on the server (I already coded this, using ""create"" method in ""users"" service) based on the unique ID of the Phone and the Phone software version (got using react-native-device-info). And then, for the authentication, it authenticates using this unique_id and the phone_version. But, for the moment, I'm stuck in feathers-authenticate. I don't know how can I do to authenticate with two parameters without having a password that needs bcrypt, and then returns a token to authenticate later requests, containing for example the user_id in database, a jwt,... Well I'm quite lost with local strategy, jwt strategy... Even with passportJS docs 😢 So my question is : is it possible, with feathers-authentication, to authenticate without a password but always using an unique identifier (not a ""mail"" in my case, but a couple of datas : ""unique_id"" and ""phone_version"") ? Then, I want an unique channel for the user to chat with only one other user, so, during authentication, I may need to send back to the app some user identifier (like unique user_id in database) to not mix every requests once the user is sending messages and receiving ones... P.S. : I think that my question is newbie, but I'm just starting 😢"

I read through a issue post on github https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-mongoose/issues/165#issuecomment-282206324.

app.service('messages').create({

 return app.service('messages').update(message._id, {

On the first launching of the app, a new user is automatically created on the server (I already coded this, using ""create"" method in ""users"" service) based on the unique ID of the Phone and the Phone software version (got using react-native-device-info). And then, for the authentication, it authenticates using this unique_id and the phone_version. But, for the moment, I'm stuck in feathers-authenticate. I don't know how can I do to authenticate with two parameters without having a password that needs bcrypt, and then returns a token to authenticate later requests, containing for example the user_id in database, a jwt,... Well I'm quite lost with local strategy, jwt strategy... Even with passportJS docs 😢 So my question is : is it possible, with feathers-authentication, to authenticate without a password but always using an unique identifier (not a ""mail"" in my case, but a couple of datas : ""unique_id"" and ""phone_version"") ? Then, I want an unique channel for the user to chat with only one other user, so, during authentication, I may need to send back to the app some user identifier (like unique user_id in database) to not mix every requests once the user is sending messages and receiving ones... P.S. : I think that my question is newbie, but I'm just starting 😢"

ObjectId(59fd60cfc1668e6f02250eb1),Hello! I am completely stumped… Currently the app I am working on uses feathers both on client side and server side. All requests from client are sent over with socket.io. Recently I’ve started building out tests for our backend and I’m using just a standard REST for these calls instead of socket.io and what I’ve noticed is the requests are being handled different. Ultimately it looks like I need to parse all strings for params (which I can do and this is stated in the docs) but I can’t see how I change the hook.id. Currently any REST call with a hook.id only shows as a string of say ”1” or even ”null” How or where can I modify this before it hits the service?

ObjectId(59fd60d2c1668e6f02250ef6),"Hi ! First of all, thank you for feathersJS, I'm currently learning it to deploy my new app ! But a little question about authentication in feathers. I well understand how it works with email+password, but I want to use a different way. Actually, I'm coding a react native app, and I don't want the users to login or register themselves. On the first launching of the app, a new user is automatically created on the server (I already coded this, using ""create"" method in ""users"" service) based on the unique ID of the Phone and the Phone software version (got using react-native-device-info). And then, for the authentication, it authenticates using this unique_id and the phone_version. But, for the moment, I'm stuck in feathers-authenticate. I don't know how can I do to authenticate with two parameters without having a password that needs bcrypt, and then returns a token to authenticate later requests, containing for example the user_id in database, a jwt,... Well I'm quite lost with local strategy, jwt strategy... Even with passportJS docs 😢 So my question is : is it possible, with feathers-authentication, to authenticate without a password but always using an unique identifier (not a ""mail"" in my case, but a couple of datas : ""unique_id"" and ""phone_version"") ? Then, I want an unique channel for the user to chat with only one other user, so, during authentication, I may need to send back to the app some user identifier (like unique user_id in database) to not mix every requests once the user is sending messages and receiving ones... P.S. : I think that my question is newbie, but I'm just starting 😢"

@lenny If I understand correctly you want, within a setInterval, to call a non-Feathers API on another server and then update a Feathers service. There is nothing particularly Feathers about this, just JS. Feathers REST and WebSocket clients cannot call a random non-Feathers server. You'd have to use fetch, axios, superagent, etc."

But the response is returned before the stream functionality is finished. I assumed that fs.createReadStream is synchronous, but I guess the on and pipe appendings are not. Therefore, I tried to return fs.createReadStream but I would get after-hook returned an invalid hook object error. If I return Promise.resolve(hook) after the whole stream functionality, the result is the same as the initial. How can I chain the stuff so that I return only after the .on('end') is done?"

I think the browser load up everything and sending it over socket, and the server catching the whole thing in memory and when finish it spits out to the blobstorage. And we are back to the situation when we want to avoid huge memory usage right? When I upload only small images, it won’t be a problem, but with video I think I’ll have some memory problems. The same with progress tracking. I cannot find with socketio a way to track the upload progress. Is any event emitting to track a longrunning request completion (it must be several frames to send to the server, and I think we can track that) 2. If we stick to REST, there is another ‘small’ glitch. I need to protect the /uploads endpoint, that only authenticated users can access it. With service it is easy, but the multer fires before the service and collect the whole file. The main question where the beforeHook function is fire, before the multer or as I think after the multer and before the service call?
